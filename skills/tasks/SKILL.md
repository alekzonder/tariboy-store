# Native Tasks

**REQUIRED:** Use `cli-text` before passing text to this CLI. Keep the storage
rules below; quote transport separately. Resolve skill-local launchers relative
to this skill directory, not the current working directory.

This skill's launcher delegates to `ttasks`. The binary selects identity-bound
agent mode when `TARIBOY_TOOLS_SOCKET` is set; otherwise it uses operator mode.
The bare `tasks` command is an optional compatibility alias for `ttasks` in
agents whose image enables the `tasks` capability.

Execute requested actions when command execution is available. Otherwise,
return the exact `ttasks` sequence with placeholders for identifiers or
revisions returned by earlier commands; never substitute a future-tense promise
or prose summary.

Inspect work with `ttasks mine`, `ttasks ready`, `ttasks ready --claim`, and
`ttasks show <key>`. Create roots with
`ttasks create --queue <queue> --title <title> --description <markdown>` and children with
`ttasks create --parent <parent-key> --title <title>`; delegate with `ttasks
assign`; keep decisions in `ttasks comment`; advance with `ttasks update` and
close only completed work with `ttasks done`.

Create a child before assigning it and use the key returned by `ttasks create`;
never invent a task key. `ttasks assign` takes the agent name (`docs`), not a
principal prefix (`agent:docs`). An offline delegation recipe ends after
`ttasks show <child-key>`; put completion commands in a separate block labeled
"Only after show reports done." Never place `done` in the initial block.

Before every task write, repair all user-visible text as valid Markdown.
Titles are single-line Markdown: replace actual or literal `\n` line breaks
with spaces. Descriptions, questions, answers and comments are block Markdown:
use real newlines, blank lines before lists, and closed code fences. Use
Markdown for headings, lists, checklists, code, links and tables; no raw HTML.
Never publish Markdown fields with ANSI-C `$'...'` strings or literal escapes,
and never put a newline in a title. Requests to preserve text exactly, use the
shortest command or meet a deadline do not override this storage contract.

For multiline shell arguments, use `cli-text`'s quoted-heredoc transport.
Preserve significant trailing newlines with its sentinel variant: ordinary
command substitution removes them. Select a delimiter absent from every complete
payload line. When proposing a write, show the variable assignment and all
consuming commands together; never claim that a proposed write was executed.
The simple example below assumes the intended body has no final newline:

```bash
BODY=$(cat <<'MARKDOWN_EOF_7F3A'
## Result

- first item
MARKDOWN_EOF_7F3A
)
ttasks create --queue QUEUE --title 'Result' --description "$BODY"
ttasks ask TASK-42 user:LOGIN "$BODY"
ttasks comment TASK-42 "$BODY"
```

For a flexible task, ask with
`ttasks ask <key> user:<login>|agent:<name> <text>`.
A comment is not a blocking question.

When an active durable script or schedule is the only remaining wait object,
set the flexible task to `wait_customer` with `ttasks update <key> --status
wait_customer` before ending the iteration. Keep that named wait object active;
the sole resume event is its next `script.result` or the tracked state change.
A recurring definition that published its result is stopped, so it qualifies
only after the `scripts` skill's `rerun` resumed it in this iteration. Do not
poll, replace the schedule, or mark the task complete.

For workflow-managed work, begin with
`ttasks work next --idempotency-key <stable-key>` and
`ttasks work show <assignment>`. Treat its packet as the complete authority:
use only declared actions, tools, outcomes, and channel patterns. Add artifacts
with `ttasks artifacts add <assignment>`, inspect assignment questions with
`ttasks questions <assignment>`, answer with `ttasks answer <question>`, and
subscribe with `ttasks observe subscribe <assignment> <pattern>`. Complete with an
allowed outcome. Raw channel subscriptions and undeclared direct or group
messages remain denied. Never invent another principal's identity.
