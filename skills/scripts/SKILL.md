# Durable Scripts

This skill's `scripts/scripts.sh` launcher lives inside this skill directory
and calls the identity-bound daemon through `TARIBOY_TOOLS_SOCKET`.
Execute the launcher when command execution is available. If it is unavailable,
return the exact command instead; never claim a script was queued, scheduled,
cancelled, or removed unless the command succeeded.

Run once with `scripts/scripts.sh run <name> -- <command>`. Queue it exactly once,
finish the iteration, and consume the later `script.result` message instead of
waiting in the current iteration.

Run repeatedly with `scripts/scripts.sh schedule <name> --every <seconds> -- <command>`.
Runs never overlap. `--quiet-exit CODE` records that exit without waking the
agent; other nonzero exits remain failures.

Inspect with `scripts/scripts.sh ls`, `scripts/scripts.sh runs`, and
`scripts/scripts.sh logs`; use `scripts/scripts.sh rerun`,
`scripts/scripts.sh cancel`, or `scripts/scripts.sh rm` for lifecycle control.
A schedule cancellation also stops its active run; cancelling one run leaves
its schedule intact.
